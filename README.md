# Data Wrangling
Data wrangling involves cleaning and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships in the data. This helps in identifying patterns, trends, and potential outliers.

# Model Building
Model building involves selecting and training machine learning algorithms to predict resale flat prices. This includes model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

#Model Deployment
Model deployment involves creating an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input data and get price predictions. The app also provides visualizations for better understanding.
